# Introduction

Ab-Ag-AFF extracts sequence features from the heavy and light chains of antibodies using an antibody language model, and simultaneously captures rich evolutionary information from the antigen sequence via ESM2. These integrated features are then fed into a deep learning framework to enable accurate prediction of antibody-antigen binding affinity.
